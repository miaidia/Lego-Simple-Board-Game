- Jedi (e.g., Obi-Wan, Yoda)  
- Droid (e.g., R2-D2, C-3PO)

### 3. **Game Board:**
- Build a path with LEGO bricks or use the provided map.

### 4. **Character Dice:**
All characters use the same custom die with images:

- 3x 🦵 **Foot** – used for movement or evasion  

> You can 3D print the dice with large, colorful symbols for better visibility.---
